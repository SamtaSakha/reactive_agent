# reactive agent
When changes occur in its surroundings, a reactive AI agent reacts immediately to them without the need of internal models or convoluted decision-making procedures. These agents respond to their surroundings by eliciting basic rules or behaviors. Reactive agents are sentient entities, that respond to their environment instinctively, much like insects do to different stimuli.
